**Write a program that will determine the factorial values of integers starting with the number 1 and display all factorials up to a user inputted value.
Constraints**

Factorials and their results are displayed as such: 4! = 24

#Requirements

	• Display an opening welcome statement and menu as such:
		Welcome to my factorial program! Please choose from the following:
		1. Run Program
		2. Exit Program

	• Use a Switch/Case block that executes depending upon menu choice
	• Use a for loop to determine and output the data
	• Implement a do...while loop to run the program again
	• This program will utilize code learned from Week 1 through Week 5

#Hints
	• The factorials can grow exponentially so be mindful of this when you make your variable declarations (Google BigInteger)
	• Notice that the factorial begins at 1 and there are 10 values returned when the user requested 10. This requested number can be larger or smaller   depending on user input
	• Notice how some of the output instructions, welcome, menu, etc. are not repeated in the second run
